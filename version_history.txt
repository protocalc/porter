          thread since the camera is opened in the main thread)
        - Solved a possible connection error on the ublox if the baudrate
          is reverted back to the default one
        - Solved a bug for configuration setting

        - Added search for first message in Kernel decoder
        - Correct a bug in closing sensors
        - Added name attribute for the ADC
        - Correct a bug where the Valon was started first with AM on and
          then started again with AM off but AM stayed on
        - Set sensors as non daemon threads
        - Added check on ADC sleeps    
v2.7  : - Added decoder for ADC data
        - Use of argparse for inclinometer and gps decoders
        - Add response of the valon to the logger
v2.6.1: - Correct a bug in packing teh ADC value
        - Correct a bug in connecting ADC to different bus
        - Corrct valon baudrate in config
v2.6  : - Added option for ADC connection info
        - Correct connection info for the valon and ADC
v2.5  : - Solved bugs in camera parameters input
        - Added a time.sleep after camera inizialization
        - Correct position of the logger created
v2.4.1: - Correct minor bug in camera configuration and camera library
          import
v2.4  : - UBlox and Inclinometer decoders have been tested and worked
        - Changed the decoder of multiple messages for the inclinometer
v2.4b : - Added first attempt to decoder scripts for inclinometera and
          ublox (untested in beta)
v2.3  : - Solved a bug in GPS configuration 
        - Rewrote the configuration method in the handler
        - Solved a bug in GPS reader
        - Removed chunk_size from the option in threads. Each message is
          read considiring its proper length
        - Added time of the first inclinometer message
v2.2  : - Explicitly stop the inclinometer
        - Solved a bug in calculation of the length for the inclinometer 
          payload
        - Solved a bug in the ACK message from the inclinometer
v2.1  : - Formatted all the code with black
        - Added a close function to the different sensors
        - Changed the path for saving data and log together
v2.0.1: - Solved minor bugs throughout the code
v2.0  : - Removed all the old GUI files to control the telemetry from the
          ground
        - Removed all the ublox files, now everything is done through
          pyubx2
        - Removed camera control from porter, now it is a separate library
        - A single script is now used with different configuration for
          different scenarios
        - Data from sensors are now saved as .bin file and like a unique
          string of bytes
